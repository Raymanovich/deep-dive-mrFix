\section{Introduction}

This document is part of the project executed by students at the Bit Academy in Amsterdam, 
at the request of Michiel Ybema, representative of mrFix. MrFix is a company aiming to 
easily connect customers in need of home repair or improvement with trustworthy
professionals. The project's duration is one week. This project's mission is to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Analyse the various useflows within mrFix's services, and their competitors and 
		come up with a preliminary design for a mobile app.
	\item Build a minimal working prototype for a mobile app suitable for the business of 
		mrFix based on this design.
\end{enumerate}

Throughout this document the company of mrFix may be revered to as \textit{client}, users 
of the service as \textit{customers} and the people performing the jobs as 
\textit{fixers}.

\section{Prototype requirements}

The following requirements need to be taken into consideration when designing the 
prototype: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fixers need a publicly visible profile.
	\item The app needs to include an intuitive messaging system for communication between 
		customer and fixer.
	\item Customers need a clear and accurate quote, or at least estimation, for the cost 
		of the job.
	\item The app needs to facilitate making appointments between customers and fixers.
	\item Customers need certainty that the job will be done right the first time.
	\item Customers need certainty that the invoice matches the actual work done.
	\item The app needs to handle payments from the customer to the fixer.
	\item Customers need to be able to write reviews about their fixer.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project goals}

The client has voiced an interest in the following points: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item An overview of rival apps.
	\item Clear documentation provided along with the prototype.
	\item An overview of industry standard technologies useful for building the desired 
		product.
	\item An overview of third party Software-as-a-service providers and/or open source 
		libraries to use.
\end{itemize}

\section{Target audience}

The target audience for mrFix's service is primarily well-off people with limited time 
and/or DIY skills.

\section{User stories}

Each of these \textit{user stories} represent a feature or scenario that the customers 
would reasonably expect to be provided for in the app.

\section{Technical specifications}

Technologies that will likely be used to deliver the prototype are
PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS. For installing third-party libraries composer 
and/or NPM will be used. Third party tools for building effective graphical user
interfaces will likely include TailwindCSS and Bootstrap.

More details on each of these can be found here:
