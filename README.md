# Welcome to the mrFix mockup prototype project

MrFix is a company providing a service where you can post job listings for any work in and 
around the home. MrFix will quickly and painlessly connect you with a trustworthy and 
capable professional. During a one-week project us four students at the Bit Academy will 
come up with a suitable design for a mobile app for mrFix.
